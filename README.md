# HACK: Automatically generating HArdware Component Knowledge Bases

## Dependencies

We use a few applications that you'll need to install and be sure are on your
PATH.

For OS X using [homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
$ brew install poppler
$ brew install postgresql
$ brew install libpng freetype pkg-config
```

On Debian-based distros:

```bash
$ sudo apt install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python3-dev
$ sudo apt build-dep python-matplotlib
$ sudo apt install poppler-utils
$ sudo apt install postgresql
```

For the Python dependencies, we recommend using a
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). Once you have cloned the
repository, change directories to the root of the repository and run

```bash
$ virtualenv -p python3 .venv
```

Once the virtual environment is created, activate it by running

```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Any Python libraries installed will now be contained within this virtual
environment. To deactivate the environment, simply run `deactivate`.

Then, install Fonduer and any other Python dependencies by running:

```bash
$ make dev
```

## Downloading the Datasets

Each component has its own dataset which must be downloaded before running. To
do so, navigate to each component's directory and run the download data script.
Note that you must navigate to the directory before running the script, since
the script will automatically unpack into the `data` directory.

For example, to download the Op-Amp dataset:

```
$ cd hack/opamps/
$ ./download_data.sh
```

## Running

After installing all the requirements, and ensuring the necessary databases
are created, you can run each individual hardware component script.

### Transistors

```bash
$ createdb transistors
$ python hack/transistors/transistors_all.py
```

### Op Amps

```bash
$ createdb opamps
$ python hack/opamps/opamps.py
```

### Circular Connectors

```bash
$ createdb circular_connectors
$ python hack/circular_connectors/circular_connectors.py
```

## Analysis
For our analysis, we use candidates generated by `fonduer` to create a set of
entities which are scored against ground-truth gold labels to compare knowledge
base accuracy.

### Generate Entity CSVs
After running `transistors.py` to generate a HACK knowledge base, you can then
run the analysis scripts to produce a set of entity CSVs which will then be
scored against our gold labels:

```bash
$ python hack/transistors/get_entities.py
$ python hack/transistors/analysis.py
```
Scoring will produce a set of false positive and false negative entities which
are then written to `data_discrepancies.csv` for manual evaluation.

### Use Existing Entities
For analysis purposes, you can use the included entity CSVs that were generated
from our knowledge bases. In order to exactly replicate our results, you can use
the already created entity CSVs found in `hack/transistors/analysis/` by
running:

```bash
$ python hack/transistors/analysis.py
```

This will also ouput an F1 Score and a `data_discrepancies.csv` file for manual
debugging.
